Viterbi - Receives a sequence X of nucleotids as input. Outputs a path that maximizes P(X|π) over all possible paths π. the paths belong to an HMM model with three states, to identify DNA coding regions. State 1 corresponds to the Start Site signal, state 2 corresponds to an Exon region and State 3 corresponds to an Intro region. Initial probabilities for all the three states are
equal and transitions from all the states to an end state are also equal. Trnasition and Emission probabilities are difined in the code.
